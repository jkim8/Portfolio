                        <p>I have over 20 years of experience in software development and am the software manager for
                            the multiple projects that I work with Junho Kim on. When I first met him, he was just
                            beginning and did not have much experience in coding. I began to train him in different
                            technologies (i.e., SQL, C#, JavaScript) and he was able to catch on rapidly. When I would
                            teach him something, he was able to provide quick impact because he researched and practiced
                            taught concepts and methods on his own. After a short amount of time, he coded 90% of the
                            front end on his own. Junho is very passionate and dedicated to his work and goals. He
                            resolved problems by coming up with new ideas and handled difficult situations with patience
                            and honesty. He often exceeded my expectations by going above and beyond the requirements.
                            He was accountable and could be entrusted with tasks.

                            Bethany Church. We worked together planning several big events (i.e., international weeklong
                            trips for ~20 people, conferences with 500+ people) and I also work with him weekly on a
                            team supporting stage performances. He is a very diligent, reliable teammate and always on
                            time. Junho also frequently has great ideas that go beyond what’s expected. He has a very
                            hard to find combination of characteristics- resourceful, creative, punctual, and
                            good-natured.

                        <p>I have known Junho for the past seven years as a friend and we have been members of the same
                            church for past years. Throughout past years, Junho and I have been involved in several
                            different volunteering tasks and events—I can vouch that he produces quality products; and I
                            have seen his genuine care for the people and the church community; and he leads others with
                            the purpose and vision. For example, he has been leading the Design and Media Team as the
                            team leader. His design products were always liked and praised by many of the church
                            members; even some people outside the church community actually wanted to purchase the
                            clothing products Junho designed. Junho also has been leading small groups at various
                            capacity. I have heard numerous times from the members of his small group how genuinely
                            caring Junho is and they all appreciate his service. Junho has been actively participating
                            in providing feedback and inputs to the periodic church directors’ meetings, where the
                            leaders thought some of Junho’s ideas were very creative and fitting the purpose and vision
                            of the church. Junho goes out of his way to complete the tasks on his hand and always wants
                            to lend hand to other ministry teams because he has a broad view of the church community. I
                            recommend Junho for any positions, based on his proven characteristics and records of his
                            quality products.
